## Gene Expression Analysis: Chowdary Dataset

This repository contains an analysis of the Chowdary dataset, which explores relationships between gene pairs in terms of correlation, statistical significance, and associations. The goal of this project is to identify gene pairs with strong correlations and significant associations that can provide insights into their potential roles in specific biological processes or diseases.

### Overview
### The project involves:

1) Loading and preprocessing the Chowdary dataset.
2) Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
3) Calculating correlation coefficients between gene pairs.
4) Performing t-tests and chi-square tests for gene pairs to determine statistical significance.
5) Computing Cramér's V to measure the strength of association between categorical variables.
6) Merging and comparing the results from the above analyses.
7) Interpreting the findings, discussing their implications, and drawing conclusions.


### Results
The results of this analysis are available in the Final_Results.csv file, which contains the correlations between gene pairs, their coefficients, p-values from t-test and chi-square tests, Cramér's V, and the correlation values. The results can be used as a starting point for further research into the biological significance of these relationships and their potential implications for various biological processes and diseases.
